This lib is basicaly a lazier port of the official rest implementation but I wanted to separate stuff a bit dedicating specific classes to each type of devices, since I only have a chroma enabled keyboard, that's the first class I'm puting out, but since razer offers a beta currently as of writting) for their simulator I might as well plan to the future.


- [ ] Effect Builder
- [ ] Mouse Helper
- [ ] keypad
- [ ] chromalink
- [ ] mousepad
- [ ] headset

so, I don't have any timeframe in mind to accomplish these (most likely to only create the effect builder and then stop right there [unless I get another device]).

So if you liked what you saw here and want to contribute your own *helper* feel free to do so
